                <h1>Predicting Apnea Episodes</h1>
                <div class = "row">
                    <p class = "right">One potential future improvement to the detection and treatment of apnea could be the development of more advanced predictive models that can identify patients who are at high risk of developing apnea before symptoms occur. This would allow for earlier interventions, potentially preventing the onset of the condition altogether. This could be done using a regression equation with multiple variables and seeing how well an individual's vitals follows the curve generated.</p>

                <h1>Connecting To Your Smartwatch</h1>
                <div class = "secondrow">
                    <p class = "right">Another potential improvement could be accessing the data directly from your smartwatch. This would provide a better user experience since individuals would not have to export their data and convert it each time. Instead, they could connect to their smartwatch account and automatically receive their information.</p>

                <h1>Alerting Others</h1>

                            <p class = "right">When an individual has a high probability of facing an apnea episode, it would alert the patient's healthcare provider or family members. This alert would include all relevant data and analysis, allowing the healthcare provider or family member to quickly get an overview of the patientâ€™s condition.</p>
