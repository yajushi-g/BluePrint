            <h1>Apnea Overview</h1>
            <p>Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where an individual stops breathing for an extended period of time. This is a common disorder, affecting 12% of the population (around 30 million people). Potentially fatal, sleep apnea causes 38,000 deaths each year as reported by the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research.</p>
            <p>While sleep apnea is rare in full term babies, around 50% of babies born between 33 to 35 weeks (preterm babies) get sleep apnea. Because these preterm babies are severely developed, they are more prone to experiencing apnea. Around 58% of preterm babies faced multiple apnea episodes, with 18% of them dying due apnea.</p>

            <h1>Different Types Of Apnea</h1>
            
            <h3>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</h3>
            <p>OSA is the most common type of sleep apnea and occurs when the path from the nose to the upper airway has narrowed or has an obstruction. One of the most common causes for an OSA episode is when the tissue at the back of the throat becomes soft and collapses, blocking the airway. When the airway is blocked, the individual is unable to breathe, causing an apnea episode.</p>

            <h3>Central Sleep Apnea</h3>
            <p> Central sleep apnea occurs when there is a delay in the signal responsible for telling our body to breathe while sleeping. This type of apnea is idiopathic, which means that its cause is unknown. While this apnea is less common than OSA, it is often present in premature babies or babies of mothers who smoked during their pregnancy.</p>

            <h3>Complex Sleep Apnea</h3>
            <p>The final type of sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea, is a combination of OSA and central sleep apnea. This is a newer, unknown type of sleep apnea. While the complex sleep apnea episode may first appear as an OSA episode, the breathing is still irregular after the obstruction is removed or the airway returns to its original state, indicating that collapsed throat muscles are not the only cause of the apnea. Currently, researchers are trying to gather more information about complex sleep apnea to determine its cause and defining traits.</p>
